  <h2 class="mt-10 mb-3">Ice Wall</h2>

  <p>
    Now this is where the real depth of Mei comes in. Not a single ability in the game is as versatile as this. Because of this I will be going over a few notable situations you might encounter often. But first off, let's go over how the wall actually works.
  </p>
  <p>
    The wall consists of 5 pillars, each for 500 health, and lasts 4.5 seconds. Most unexpectedly, it has a huge range of 35 meters. This is large enough to reach most reasonable locations.
  </p>

    <%= image_tag "icewall_placement.jpg", class: "h-auto w-1/1" %>
  <% end %>

  <div class="px-4 md:px-0 md:mx-4 md:w-6/12 lg:w-10/12 mw:w-4/12">
    <p>
      <strong>When first playing Mei it might be very confusing what determines where the wall will be placed.</strong> Of course you have the little indicator, but in the heat of the battle there is no time to go looking for this. In reality it's actually fairly simple. Think of the world as a 2 dimensional picture. <strong>Draw a line down from the object your crosshair is aimed at (infinite if aimed in the air), whatever object (or floor) it hits first is where the wall will be placed</strong> (As long as it is within the 35 meter range). Only static object affect the position, meaning you can't place it on anything that can be moved. <br>
      All this will take some getting used to, but once you realise what is going on, you will quickly be placing your walls like a pro.

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Choke points</h4>

  <p class="mt-0">
    The most obvious use for a wall is to close off a choke point. Wait for an enemy to enter, place a wall behind him, and finish him without having to worry about the rest of the enemy team. In the "<%= link_to "Map specific", "#" %>" chapter I will be going over specific choke points and how to utilize them.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Separating teams</h4>

  <p class="mt-0">
    You can quickly turn a teamfight in your favor by separating a team. Turning a 6v6 in a 6vX can give you a huge advtange, even if it is just for a short moment of time. Of course this is most easily done at a choke point or close quarter situation, but it does not have to be. You can place your wall in a open field and still create an advantage that you team can capitalize on. Many heroes require the defense of their team to survival, most notably the supports. Separating them can ensure a quick kill. The same can go for the opposit situation. Separating the supports away from their tanks and not allowing them to heal.

        Both supports are off to the side, with the rest of their team busy fighting. A quick wall to separate them both ensured two killed that then translated in to more. Mercy was not able to fly away and their tanks were not able to help them out quickly.

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Forcing a direction</h4>

  <p class="mt-0">
    Even if your wall does not block off anything, it can still force an enemy to walk a particular direction. This allows your team to easily fire at the enemy, as their movement will be very predictable. For example a diagonal wall might force an enemy to move back before being able to escape. Or perhaps you can block off a specific route, forcing them to stay out in the open or to change their plans.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Mobility</h4>

  <p class="mt-0">
    Wall below your feet to lift yourself up. Wall below your teammates feet to lift them up. You can help yourself and your team reach places your enemy might not expect. In the "<%= link_to "Map specific", "#" %>" chapter I will be going over specific spots. But in general, reach places to get away from enemies or surprise them. Lift yourself over a wall, and flank them. Mei doesn't have great mobility, but she can reach unexpected places, this is especially useful when trying to land a good ultimate. Mei is the only hero that can create mobility for her teammates (and enemies).
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Bridging gaps</h4>

  <p class="mt-0">
    There's many gaps that mobile characters can use to get to an objective faster. Those without mobility often have to take the long route, but with your help you can get them over.
  </p>

  <p>
    When trying to find proper spots for you and your team to reach, look for objects that might help you get higher up. Think of benches, rocks, anything that might give you that little bit of extra reach. The payload's position might open up paths that were unreachable.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Creating high ground</h4>

  <p class="mt-0">
    High ground is incredibly important. It allows you to more easily land headshots on your opponent while making it more difficult for them. Lifting yourself up in the middle of a duel can give you a large advantage.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Saving yourself and your team</h4>

  <p class="mt-0 mb-2">
    Blocking ultimates, stopping Roadhog hooks, it will all win you favor with your teammates. You can play Mei as more of a tank oriented role by focussing on keeping your teammates safe. Lifting your supports away from flankers can give them enough time to heal up and make a safe escape. Try to track the abilities your enemies use, predict ultimates and be ready to block them. Practically any ability can be block, but be careful to not block those of your teammates.

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Closing escape points</h4>

  <p class="mt-0">
    If you know your team will enter a room filled with enemies, you can often pre-emptively close an escape point from outside of that room. This will force the enemy to stay in the room and out of potential cover.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Stalling</h4>

  <p class="mt-0">
    Whether it's Payload or Point control, Mei's wall in combination with Cryo-freeze allows her to keep contesting a point for a long time. Try lifting yourself up, many enemy expect you to be behind the wall, and not on top. This in turn opens up opportunities to pick off enemies, while you wait for the rest of your team to arrive.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Blocking healthpacks</h4>

  <p class="mt-0 mb-2">
    Ice Wall is thick enough to block healthpacks when placed right on top of them. Of course those going for healthpacks are often low health, and have used their mobility to try and get there, allowing you to pick up an easy kill.

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Keeping enemies off of the objective</h4>

  <p class="mt-0">
    When overtime starts ticking fast, a well timed wall can be all that's needed to win the point. Closing up a choke point can easily win you the objective. Even when there is no choke point, the extra second it takes for enemies to walk around the wall can be all you need.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Bringing enemies in to view</h4>

  <p class="mt-0 mb-2">
    Enemies hiding behind a wall or a shield? Lift them up and bring them in to view! This can be especially useful when up against a Bastion who sits on the payload hiding behind a shield. Lift him up, and allow your team to hit him.

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Creating cover</h4>

  <p class="mt-0 mb-2">
    Let's look at a practical example. Attack on Temple of Anubis point B. The main entrance is usually being bombarded with everything they have. An Ice Wall near the point will allow your team to walk towards the point without getting poked. Dropping the wall will also add an element of surprise as it was more difficult for the enemy to see you walking towards them. There's many different situations where you might want to create cover, often it will be to prevent getting poked while you set up or prepare.

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">General advise on using your Ice Wall</h4>

  <p class="mt-0">
    While the wall can be very benefitial, it can also hurt your team. As a general rule I make sure to take down my wall as soon as I now longer know exactly what it is stopping. If it is serving no purpose, it is better to drop it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Communication is key. Tell your team when you have caught someone and make sure to listen to calls when they are about to use their ultimate. The last thing you want to do is block a friendly would-be 6 man Reinhardt Earthshatter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Enemies can hear the sound of you starting to place your Ice Wall. As soon as you press you Ice Wall they here the same sound you do. Keep this in mind when trying to be sneaky.
  </p>

  <p>
    Too often I see a Mei only use her wall in choke points. An Ice Wall in the middle of an open field can still separate a tank for a few seconds, which is all you need.
  </p>

  <p>
    Keep in mind that your Ice Wall goes on cooldown the moment you place it down, not when you remove it.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-5 font-italic">
    Even with all these different subjects, we have only scratched the surface. In the map and hero specific chapters I will go over more specific uses for your wall. And even then, a lot of it comes down to your creativity and experience. There is no ability in the game that has such a vast amount of different uses.
