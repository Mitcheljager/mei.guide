<p>
  You can be Lúcio's biggest nightmare, but he can also be yours. It all depends on how the two of you play around eachother. Lúcio's speed makes it incredibly difficult to catch him. Keeping your spray on him while he is wallriding is almost impossible. This speed is also his weakness, if he get's brought to a halt he is very vulnerable. You can use your Icewall to stop him temporarily. It does not interrupt his Wallride, but it will confuse him and force him to change direction. This alone can be enough to slow him enough for your team to collapse on him. However when and where you should focus on him is largely map and situation dependant. Because it's so difficult to catch him it's best to focus on others. However in close quarters a quick wall to close his escape leaves him practically dead. A stun in to headshot is a guaranteed kill as his ability to defend himself while stationary is very limited.

<p>
  <strong>In teamfights Lúcio is never your primary target.</strong> He is not dangerous enough to have to worry about and his heal is not strong enough to have to account for in your stun combo. <br>
  Lúcio needs line of sight of his teammates to apply his heal and, more importantly, his Ultimate. His ultimate has a short cast time so as soon as you hear his use it place a wall between him and teammates to prevent them from gaining the shield.
</p>

<p>
  Despite him being weak in fights, he is still a decent counter to Mei in the right situation and team composition. If you are defending a choke point with your Icewalls Lúcio can quickly get his team through with his speedboost. This leaves little time for you to react, allowing them to get through without getting separated. Account for this by Icewalling earlier than you usually would.
</p>

<p>
  On maps that allow Lúcio to knock his enemies of the map, such as Ilios or Lijiang Tower, it can be a good idea to keep an eye on him. You can save your teammates by walling off the drop. This is difficult to do, but if you keep proper track of him you should be able to counter his efficiently.

<span class="text-small mb-2 font-italic">Synergy: Decent</span>

<p>
  Both you and Lúcio tend to be in different positions. The two of you don't exactly synergise and might only work against eachother. Stunning a target only for Lúcio to push him aside is frustrating. The same goes the other way. Your Icewall can be a big annoyance to your Lúcio if you aren't careful. You can block his wall rides, his heals, and even his Ultimate.
</p>

<p>
  However, not all is bad. As long as the two of you keep eachother in mind you can work together decently well. His speedboost allows you to more effectively chase after slippery targets. It also allows your team to very quickly collapse on a target that you Icewalled away from their team. <br>
  <strong>Be mindful of eachother and you should be fine.</strong>
