      This <strong>Overwatch guide</strong> is aimed at <strong>experienced players</strong> wanting to learn to play as or against Mei. Mei is a very versatile and under utilized hero who can fit nearly any situation. Knowing what to do in each situation <strong>requires hero and map knowledge</strong>. While I try to get this across in this guide, it is something that largely comes from experience. <br>
      <small>This guide is aimed at PC players.</small>

    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Let's start of this guide by asking a very important question; <strong>Why Mei?</strong>. There is no hero in the game as versatile as Mei. She can quickly adapt to different situations and team compositions. This takes a long time to learn and get used to. If you are reading to guide hoping to quickly climb the competitive ladder, I'm afraid you will be disappointed. The time spend learning Mei could have been invested in learning several different heroes. <br>
      However, once you do have her playstyle down, she can be very rewarding. Not to mention, she is incredibly fun to play. This guide sets to teach you how to play in different situations and hopefully decrease the time it takes to get good at Mei.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be going over her abilities, how to play in and against specific team composition, and how to play every map. I will try to share my experience on several situations, but ultimately all that will matter is the time and effort you put in to the hero. Reading this guide will hopefylly give you a good starting point and a good understanding of what Mei is capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>My experiences are just my own, and I'm sure other Mei players have theirs. Any questions or suggestions are highly appreciated!</em>

    <h1 class="mt-5 mb-0">Abilities</h1>

    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Endothermic Blaster</h2>

    <h3 class="mt-0 mb-3">Freeze</h3>
    <p>
      This ability seems pretty straight forward on first sight. You fire out a cone, slow your targets, and eventually freeze those unlucky enough to be affected for a certain amount of time. However when looking at it closely, the ability might be very different than expected. Let's go over some stats.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>45 damage per second, or 2.25 damage per ammo. Coming up to 20 ammo per second.</li>
      <li>30 ammo to freeze someone. (Roughly 1.5 seconds)</li>
      <li>10 Meters maximum range.</li>
      <li>Projectile speed of 20 meters per second.</li>
      <li>Reload time of 1.5 seconds.</li>
      <li>Total stun duration of 1.5 seconds.</li>
      <li>Slow degrades over 1.5 seconds (At maximum freeze)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As you might be able to tell, a lot of these stats depend on eachother. It takes 1.5 seconds to freeze someone, to reload, the stun lasts 1.5 seconds, and the freeze degrades over 1.5 seconds. This means reloading leaves no time to continue freezing or to fire one more shot at a stunned target. Also note, freezing a target takes 1.5 seconds but only when the freeze is never interrupted. Missing the targets for a fraction of a second will result in the slow degrading, and thus a longer time to slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something you may not have known is the fact that the gun actually has a rather slow projectile speed. At a maximum range of 10 meters it takes 0.5 seconds for the freeze to reach its target. This also means you can stop freezing someone a fraction earlier than you might expect, as some of the spray is still traveling. Timing this correct can result in being able to land 2 easy headshots on a stunned target, more on this later.<br>
      This also has some interesting results when trying to fire while walking. If you are chasing someone you reach isn't actually 10 meters. In the 0.5 seconds it takes for the freeze to reach, you will have walked in to it, and thus lowered the effective range. When walking backwards this effect is reversed, allowing for a higher effective range. This isn't something that comes in to play often, but it's something to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the freeze is based on ammo (or ticks) fired on a target, damage boosts do not decrease the time it takes to freeze a target. Because of this it might be more efficient to use your Icicle (right click) when affected by Ana's ultimate. But in general damage boosts should never be deliberately applied to you, as they have little effect.<br>
      <strong>The freeze time and damage dealt are not affected by headshots.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the effect might suggest otherwise, the freeze stops on the first target it hits. Making it impossible to freeze multiple targets with one continuous blast. However, it is possible to stun more than one target at once. This can be done by gradually swapping target until both are near the freezing point, at which point you can stun one after another. In practice this has very little use, but learning to do this properly can give you a better understanding of how the freeze works. I highly suggest trying this in practice mode.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Icicle</h3>
    <p>
      Of course this works great together with your freeze. Freeze a target, and headshot them. This can be all you use the icicle for, and you will have decent results. But the ability has a little more depth than that. Let's look at some stats again.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deals 75-22 damage, based on distance</li>
      <li>Damage stats to fall off at 26 meters, up to a minumum damage at 55 meters.</li>
      <li>A shot takes 25 ammo</li>
      <li>Charging a shot takes 0.4 seconds.</li>
      <li>Mei can fire 1.2 shots per second.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since the damage falls off rather quickly, playing Mei as a sniper is not exactly viable. You will need to get in close and personal. Since the shots are rather slow and hard to hit, you will need to use this in combination with your freeze. Against low health targets fully freezing a target is not always necessary. Simply slowing the target enough to easily headshot someone can be enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a stun you have time to land a single headshot, unless you time it right. As talked about in the previous chapter, your freeze has a travel time. You can start charging your shot in the time it takes for the rest of the freeze to arrive. This can result in being able to land two headshots, up to a total of 300 damage off of icicle alone, 380 with your freeze combined. This is enough to kill any non-tank.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 200 health targets one headshot (in combination with your freeze) is enough to kill. For 250 health targets you will be dealing roughly 230 damage with this combo. Follow this combo with a melee attack to finish off the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      With more advanced tactics you can also kill a high health target with a single stun. Freeze the target until they are almost stunned, land a headshot, finish the freeze and land two more headshots. This results in 550 damage, allowing you to land one more bodyshot for the kill. This can all be done in about 3.5 seconds. Of course most tanks have a way of preventing this, such as a Zarya bubble or a Roadhog heal. Key is to know what your targets have used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always go in to a fight knowing your limits and your targets limits. Don't rely on thinking you are better than your target, rely on pure statistics to take out your targets. I will go more in-depth on this in a later chapter.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Cryo-freeze</h2>

    <p>
      This ability is often used from by players new to playing Mei. You're low health, scary stuff is happening around you, so you freeze up and heal, right? Well yes, sometimes that is the best course of action. But the ability is much better used as a dodge, than as a "get out of jail free card". The main problem with Cryofreeze is that it is super obvious where you are and what you are doing. Enemies can focus you right when you get out of your freeze. Instead use it to predict and dodge enemy attacks that will make a difference in fights. Such as a McCree flashbang or Roadhog hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this is all situational and will mostly come down to experience. Don't be afraid to use the cooldown on this ability and practice different scenarios. In some cases the best course of action might be to sit it out and wait for enemies to use their abilities. Some obvious cases are Pharah and Hanzo ultimates. If your healers are nearby and able to focus you, let them do the healing, don't panic when you get low and want to use your ability just to heal.
    </p>
    <p>
      To contradict my previous point, sometimes it is best to use it just to heal. If a fight is over, your healers are dead, or you know you won't be needing it for the duration of the cooldown, you can use it to charge your ultimate. Using the full 150 health gain can earn your roughly 10% of your ultimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all a lot of what I said here contradicts each other, and with good reason. The ability is very versatile and a lot will come down to you knowing your limits, and knowing what will be going on in a fight. In other words; experience.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Ice Wall</h2>

    <p>
      Now this is where the real depth of Mei comes in. Not a single ability in the game is as versatile as this. Because of this I will be going over a few notable situations you might encounter often. But first off, let's go over how the wall actually works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall consists of 5 pillars, each for 500 health, and lasts 4.5 seconds. Most unexpectedly, it has a huge range of 35 meters. This is large enough to reach most reasonable locations.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="md:mt-5 flex flex-column-reverse md:flex-row align-start justify-center -mx-4">
  <%= image_tag "https://placehold.it/1920x1080", class: "h-auto px-4 md:px-0 md:mx-4 w-1/1 md:w-6/12 lg:w-5/12 mw:w-4/12" %>

  <div class="px-4 md:px-0 md:mx-4 md:w-6/12 lg:w-5/12 mw:w-4/12">
    <p>
      <strong>When first playing Mei it might be very confusing what determines where the wall will be placed.</strong> Of course you have the little indicator, but in the heat of the battle there is no time to go looking for this. In reality it's actually fairly simple. Think of the world as a 2 dimensional picture. <strong>Draw a line down from your crosshair, whatever object (or floor) it hits first is where the wall will be placed</strong> (As long as it is within the 35 meter range). Only static object affect the position, meaning you can't place it on anything that can be moved. <br>
      All this will take some getting used to, but once you realise what is going on, you will quickly be placing your walls like a pro.
    </p>

  <div class="md:w-5/6 lg:w-4/6 mx-auto">
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Choke points</h4>

    <p class="mt-0">
      The most obvious use for a wall is to close off a choke point. Wait for an enemy to enter, place a wall behind him, and finish him without having to worry about the rest of the enemy team. In the "<%= link_to "Map specific", "#" %>" chapter I will be going over specific choke points and how to utilize them.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Separating teams</h4>

    <p class="mt-0">
      You don't always have a choke point to support your walls. In the middle of a team fight a wall can be a great way of separating enemies away from their healers, dps, or whatever it might be. You can place your wall in the middle of an open field, and still win a few seconds, which might be enough to get a kill or two. Inside buildings it can be extra effective, as there might not be a way around your wall.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Mobility</h4>

    <p class="mt-0">
      Wall below your feet to lift yourself up. Wall below your teammates feet to lift them up. You can help yourself and your team reach places your enemy might not expect. In the "<%= link_to "Map specific", "#" %>" chapter I will be going over specific spots. But in general, reach places to get away from enemies or surprise them. Lift yourself over a wall, and flank them. Mei doesn't have great mobility, but she can reach unexpected places, this is especially useful when trying to land a good ultimate. Mei is the only hero that can create mobility for her teammates (and enemies).
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Creating high ground</h4>

    <p class="mt-0">
      High ground is incredibly important. It allows you to easily headshot your opponent while making it more difficult for them. Lifting yourself up in the middle of a duel can give you a large advantage.
