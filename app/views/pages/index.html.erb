      This <strong>Overwatch guide</strong> is aimed at <strong>experienced players</strong> wanting to learn to play as or against Mei. Mei is a very versatile and under utilized hero who can fit nearly any situation. Knowing what to do in each situation <strong>requires hero and map knowledge</strong>. While I try to get this across in this guide, it is something that largely comes from experience. <br>
      <small>This guide is aimed at PC players.</small>

    <p>
      Let's start of this guide by asking a very important question; <strong>Why Mei?</strong>. There is no hero in the game as versatile as Mei. She can quickly adapt to different situations and team compositions. This takes a long time to learn and get used to. If you are reading to guide hoping to quickly climb the competitive ladder, I'm afraid you will be disappointed. The time spend learning Mei could have been invested in learning several different heroes. <br>
      However, once you do have her playstyle down, she can be very rewarding. Not to mention, she is incredibly fun to play. This guide sets to teach you how to play in different situations and hopefully decrease the time it takes to get good at Mei.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be going over her abilities, how to play in and against specific team composition, and how to play every map. I will try to share my experience on several situations, but ultimately all that will matter is the time and effort you put in to the hero. Reading this guide will hopefylly give you a good starting point and a good understanding of what Mei is capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>My experiences are just my own, and I'm sure other Mei players have theirs. Any questions or suggestions are highly appreciated!</em>

    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Endothermic Blaster</h2>

    <h3 class="mt-0 mb-3">Freeze</h3>
    <p>
      This ability seems pretty straight forward on first sight. You fire out a cone, slow your targets, and eventually freeze those unlucky enough to be affected for a certain amount of time. However when looking at it closely, the ability might be very different than expected. Let's go over some stats.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>45 damage per second, or 2.25 damage per ammo. Coming up to 20 ammo per second.</li>
      <li>30 ammo to freeze someone. (Roughly 1.5 seconds)</li>
      <li>10 Meters maximum range.</li>
      <li>Projectile speed of 20 meters per second.</li>
      <li>Reload time of 1.5 seconds.</li>
      <li>Total stun duration of 1.5 seconds.</li>
      <li>Slow degrades over 1.5 seconds (At maximum freeze)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As you might be able to tell, a lot of these stats depend on eachother. It takes 1.5 seconds to freeze someone, to reload, the stun lasts 1.5 seconds, and the freeze degrades over 1.5 seconds. This means reloading leaves no time to continue freezing or to fire one more shot at a stunned target. Also note, freezing a target takes 1.5 seconds but only when the freeze is never interrupted. Missing the targets for a fraction of a second will result in the slow degrading, and thus a longer time to slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something you may not have known is the fact that the gun actually has a rather slow projectile speed. At a maximum range of 10 meters it takes 0.5 seconds for the freeze to reach its target. This also means you can stop freezing someone a fraction earlier than you might expect, as some of the spray is still traveling. Timing this correct can result in being able to land 2 easy headshots on a stunned target, more on this later.<br>
      This also has some interesting results when trying to fire while walking. If you are chasing someone you reach isn't actually 10 meters. In the 0.5 seconds it takes for the freeze to reach, you will have walked in to it, and thus lowered the effective range. When walking backwards this effect is reversed, allowing for a higher effective range. This isn't something that comes in to play often, but it's something to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the freeze is based on ammo (or ticks) fired on a target, damage boosts do not decrease the time it takes to freeze a target. Because of this it might be more efficient to use your Icicle (right click) when affected by Ana's ultimate. But in general damage boosts should never be deliberately applied to you, as they have little effect.<br>
      <strong>The freeze time and damage dealt are not affected by headshots.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the effect might suggest otherwise, the freeze stops on the first target it hits. Making it impossible to freeze multiple targets with one continuous blast. However, it is possible to stun more than one target at once. This can be done by gradually swapping target until both are near the freezing point, at which point you can stun one after another. In practice this has very little use, but learning to do this properly can give you a better understanding of how the freeze works. I highly suggest trying this in practice mode.
